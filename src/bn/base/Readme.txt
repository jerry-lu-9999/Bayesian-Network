The standard input format should be 

java -cp "./bin" bn/base/xxxxx 

When I'm testing, my current directory is with bin and src inside the folder "Bayesian network"

I dont want to print out informative messages because for some files in the example, it would take forever to run.

FYI : There would be different exceptions printed out if you 

1. no such file exceptions
2. no such variable(NoSuchElementException: Check Your Variable Name Again Por Favor!)

So be sure to avoid possible typo. 
Thank you and wash your hands!
